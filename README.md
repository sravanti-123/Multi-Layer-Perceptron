A multilayer perceptron is a feedforward neural network which can distinguish data that is not linearly separable. Here, two multilayer perceptrons functioning in heteroassociative and autoassociative mode are designed, trained and tested on a small dataset of alphanumeric characters.These models are built based on 2 approaches :

● Approach 1: Simple network with scalar output

● Approach 2:Fully-connected Network with Image Output

The models are also re-tested on noise-corrupted image dataset to observe the performance. The goal is to optimize the MLP to give the best possible results.
